# Phishing Detection

Phishing Detection is a project aimed at predicting the authenticity of domains, determining whether they are genuine or malicious. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and how it works.

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of fraudulent activity where attackers masquerade as reputable companies or individuals to deceive victims into sharing sensitive information. Typically, phishing attempts are made through emails or other communication channels. Attackers create convincing messages, often imitating well-known brands, and persuade recipients to click on malicious links or provide confidential data like login credentials or account information.

## Project Objective

The main goal of the Phishing Detection project is to develop a system that can accurately identify whether a domain is genuine or malicious. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing various features, such as email content, sender information, and URL characteristics, the system aims to provide a reliable prediction on the legitimacy of a domain.

## How it Works

1. Data Collection: The project gathers a comprehensive dataset comprising legitimate and known phishing domains. The dataset is carefully curated and labeled to ensure accuracy.

2. Feature Extraction: Various features are extracted from the collected data to capture important indicators of phishing attempts. These features may include email content, header information, URL properties, and more.

3. Model Training: Machine learning algorithms are employed to train a predictive model using the labeled dataset. The model learns to identify patterns and characteristics associated with both legitimate and phishing domains.

4. Testing and Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and performance. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to measure the model's effectiveness.

5. Deployment: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed as a standalone system or integrated into existing security solutions. It can be utilized to scan and analyze incoming emails or website URLs to flag potential phishing attempts.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- `data/`: This directory stores the collected dataset, divided into separate folders for legitimate and phishing domains.
- `feature_extraction.py`: This script is responsible for extracting relevant features from the dataset, preparing the data for model training.
- `model_training.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to train the predictive model using the extracted features.
- `evaluation.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate the trained model on a test dataset, presenting performance metrics and visualizations.
- `deployment/`: This directory contains resources and guidelines for deploying the trained model into a production environment.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow the instructions provided in each script or notebook file. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed before executing the code. The repository serves as a comprehensive guide for training a phishing detection model and evaluating its performance.
